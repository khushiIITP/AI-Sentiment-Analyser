## 🛠️ Technologies

### Backend (Python)
- TextBlob for sentiment analysis
- VADER Sentiment for social media text
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

## 📊 Analysis Methodology

### 1. Data Loading & Validation
- CSV file reading and validation
- Column structure verification
- Data quality assessment

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Text normalization and preprocessing
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Missing value handling
- Quality filtering

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- **TextBlob Analysis**:
  - Polarity scoring (-1 to +1)
  - Subjectivity measurement (0 to 1)
  - Rule-based sentiment classification
  
- **VADER Analysis**:
  - Compound sentiment score
  - Individual positive/negative/neutral scores
  - Social media optimized analysis

### 4. Classification Logic
- Positive: Polarity > 0.1 or Compound ≥ 0.05
- Negative: Polarity < -0.1 or Compound ≤ -0.05
- Neutral: Between thresholds

### 5. Insights Generation
- Statistical summaries
- Trend analysis
- Key word extraction
- Satisfaction scoring

## 🎨 Dashboard Features

### Visual Components
- **Stat Cards**: Key metrics with gradient backgrounds
- **Interactive Charts**: Multiple visualization types
- **Chart Selector**: Switch between pie, bar, and line charts
- **Analysis Results**: Detailed insights and metrics
- **Review Examples**: Most positive/negative review highlights

### User Experience
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Real-time loading states
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Export functionality for reports
- Responsive design for all devices

## 📈 Sample Results

Based on the 30-review dataset:
- **Total Reviews**: 30
